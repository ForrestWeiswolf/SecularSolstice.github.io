# Find My Tribe
## By Raymond Arnold
## Seeking a community, despite our individualist natures

This song has been through a few versions.  The lyrics here are among the older.  Then there's the bandcamp version.  The sheet music labeled "transcript" is an attempt to transcribe that version.  The "dspeyer" version combines the transcript with a few of the older lyrics and chords based loosely on the bandcamp, all to create a hopefully complete version.

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [2014](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2014) album.
