We hear the sound of peace but it’s different this time.
We’re gonna build this world together.
It’s the eternal cry of human kind.
We’re gonna build this world together

We hear the sound of hope, the sound of peace
It’s a new day for a new generation
A new time no beginning no end
We’re gonna build this world together.

Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice
We're going to build this world together
We'll sing a song of pece in a different voice
We're going to build this world together

We hear the sound of hope, the sound of peace
It’s a new day for a new generation
A new time no beginning no end
We’re gonna build this world together.

We must study and teach exploring new ways
Were gonna build this world together
So the children will grow and be the teachers one day
We’re gonna build this world together

We hear the sound of hope, the sound of peace
It’s a new day for a new generation
A new time no beginning no end
We’re gonna build this world together

Build this world
We’re gonna build this world together
Come on together and build this world

We’re each of us different and this makes us strong.
We’re gonna build this world together
And we need every voice to sing this new song
We’re gonna build this world together

We hear the sound of hope, the sound of peace
It’s a new day for a new generation
A new time no beginning no end
We’re gonna build this world together

We’re gonna build this world together
We’re gonna build this world together
We’re gonna build this world together
Oh yeah!
