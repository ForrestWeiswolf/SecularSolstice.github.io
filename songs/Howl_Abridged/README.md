#  Howl Abridged
## by Allen Ginsberg (abridged by Daniel Speyer
## What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?

Originally a [poem](/speeches/gen/Howl.html), one of the most famous
of the Beat Movement.  Also, the inspiration for [Meditations on
Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).

I haven't really converted it into a song.  I've just put some
suitably creepy cello under it, while shortening it to 11 lines (an
unresolved chromatic scale).  The first line has a minor second, and
the interval widens each time until it's a major seventh.  Also, the
leading "Moloch"s go up a minor third from the upper note, then down a
tritone, then back to the drone.  All of this *may* be more clear
looking at the sheet music (no promises).
