There's a reason why they're building a sphere around the sun
  It's to capture all the power when the work is done
And that's to have a gigantic computer simulation run
  The program is designed for us to have fun

The program is designed for us to have a lot of
Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun

But there's a plan for the things that we want to learn
  How societies form and sometimes, how they burn
We are looking to put our efforts into something new
  Tired of the tried and true, we want something more fun

The program is designed for us to have a lot of
Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun

Sign the waiver right here, jump into the chair
  I'll also need your initials right there and there
Soon you'll be subsisting or you could be a millionaire
  There's merit in both perspectives, we think that's fair

The program is designed for us to have a lot of
Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun

Oh we'll lock your memories for the duration of your stay
We find that it's best if you don't know that you're there to play
play play play

But there's an exception if you're really afraid of life
  In this project noone will stab you with a knife
You can be forever safe if you price
  So many footnotes, but we don't say any lies

Yes the program is designed for us to have some
Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun

And some Fridays when it gets a little loose around the office
  Yes, we have an office, huh
We'll take a little look inside your head when we hit the pause button
  That's a little creepy, but we went with it

And the program is designed for us to have a lot of
Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
