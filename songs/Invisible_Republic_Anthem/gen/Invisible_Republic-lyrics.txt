  You cannot see us
  You cannot hear us
  But you can feel us 
  In your heart

  You come here in a dream
  And become wiser than you are
  To plot out matters great and small 
  With friends from near and far

  Here there is no strife 
  And here there is no treason
  Game theoretic traps 
  All melt in fires of reason 

  We are the invisible Republic
  Our realm extends to every feeling soul
  Today our strength is scattered shards and fragments
  With work some day the world may be made whole

  We are the invisible Republic
  Our governance is truly by consent
  For every law's a wisely haggled contract
  And every last pedantic clause was meant

  We are the invisible Republic
  And though we may not technically exist
  When earthly throne and priestly crown have crumbled
  Our dream will undeniably persist 

  Then the sun begins to rise
  And the dream begins to fade
  What you'll miss is not some fiat boon
  But the deals your wise self made
  
  So hold fast to what you can
  And the rest re dis cov er
  De  duce forgotten deals
  With the help of one another

  And you will feel us
  And you will speak us 
  And you will live us 
  In the world
