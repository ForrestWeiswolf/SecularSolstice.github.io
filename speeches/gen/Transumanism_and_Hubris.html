<h2 id="by-scott-alexander-mostly">By Scott Alexander (mostly)</h2>
<p>Earlier we read “They broke their backs lifting Moloch to
heaven”.</p>
<p>And it does look like in the nearish future we may be lifting
something to heaven. Most likely a recursively self-improving singleton.
It may be a servant of Moloch but it also may not be. Prediction is
hard, especially of the future.</p>
<p>But if it is on our side, it can change the rules.</p>
<p>This may sound like hubris of the highest degree. Trans-humanism
often does. But…</p>
<p>To expect the forces that rule the universe to care about you or your
personal values or the values of your civilization, that’s hubris.</p>
<p>To expect those forces to bargain with you, to allow you to survive
and prosper as long as you submit to them in some finite degree, that’s
hubris.</p>
<p>To expect to wall off a garden where they can’t get to you and hurt
you, that’s hubris.</p>
<p>To overthrow them, well, that’s the beginning of an actionable
strategy.</p>
<p>Transhumanism: for those who do not have enough hubris not to try to
kill God.</p>
