# Trans-Humanism and Hubris
## By Scott Alexander (mostly)

Earlier we read “They broke their backs lifting Moloch to heaven”.

And it does look like in the nearish future we may be lifting something to heaven.  Most likely a recursively self-improving singleton.  It may be a servant of Moloch but it also may not be.  Prediction is hard, especially of the future.

But if it is on our side, it can change the rules.

This may sound like hubris of the highest degree.  Trans-humanism often does.  But...

To expect the forces that rule the universe to care about you or your personal values or the values of your civilization, that’s hubris.

To expect those forces to bargain with you, to allow you to survive and prosper as long as you submit to them in some finite degree, that’s hubris.

To expect to wall off a garden where they can’t get to you and hurt you, that’s hubris.

To overthrow them, well, that's the beginning of an actionable strategy.

Transhumanism: for those who do not have enough hubris not to try to kill God.
